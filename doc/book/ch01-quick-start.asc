== Quick Start

This chapter is designed to get you up and running with Jekyll as quickly as
possible.

=== Installation

The best way to install Jekyll is via RubyGems:

----
gem install jekyll
----

If you encounter errors during gem installation, you may need to install the
header files for compiling extension modules for ruby 1.8:

.Debian
----
sudo apt-get install ruby1.8-dev
----

.Red Hat / CentOS / Fedora systems
----
sudo yum install ruby-devel
----

.NearlyFreeSpeech
----
RB_USER_INSTALL=true gem install jekyll
----

If you encounter errors like +Failed to build gem native extension+ on Windows
you may need to install http://wiki.github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/development-kit[RubyInstaller
DevKit].

=== LaTeX to PNG

Maruku comes with optional support for LaTeX to PNG rendering via blahtex
(Version 0.6) which must be in your $PATH along with @dvips@.

(NOTE: "remi's fork of Maruku":http://github.com/remi/maruku/tree/master does
not assume a fixed location for @dvips@ if you need that fixed)

=== RDiscount

If you prefer to use
http://github.com/rtomayko/rdiscount/tree/master[RDiscount] instead of
http://maruku.rubyforge.org/[Maruku] for markdown, just make sure it's
installed:

----
sudo gem install rdiscount
----

And run Jekyll with the following option:

----
jekyll --rdiscount
----

Or, in your @_config.yml@ file put the following so you don't have to specify the flag:

----
markdown: rdiscount
----

=== Pygments

If you want syntax highlighting via the @{% highlight %}@ tag in your posts,
you'll need to install http://pygments.org/[Pygments].

.On OSX with Homebrew
----
brew install pip && pip install pygments
----

.On OSX with MacPorts
----
sudo port install python25 py25-pygments
----

.Bare OS X Leopard
----
sudo easy_install Pygments
----

.Archlinux
----
sudo pacman -S python-pygments
----

.Archlinux python2 for Pygments
----
sudo pacman -S python2-pygments
----

NOTE: python2 pygments version creates a `pygmentize2` executable, while
Jekyll tries to find `pygmentize`. Either create a symlink `# ln -s
/usr/bin/pygmentize2 /usr/bin/pygmentize` or use the python3 version.

.Ubuntu and Debian
----
sudo apt-get install python-pygments
----

.Gentoo
----
sudo emerge -av dev-python/pygments
----
